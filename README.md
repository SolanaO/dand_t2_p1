# Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

## Overview

In this project, we use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic
result of experimental psychology. We communicate our understanding of the data and we use statistical
inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.
